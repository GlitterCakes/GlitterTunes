GlitterTunes
============

Online MP3 player using HTML5 audio.

* This application works as-is, but is still in development.

* Change directories under syncMusicFiles() in /GlitterTunes/Models/MusicFiles.cs to something relative for your environment.

* In your browser, navigate to /Home/SyncLibrary to update the music library.

* This application loads up nicely in WebMatrix, an easy way to test it out.
